                    Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due to its proximity it 
                    is not easily seen except during twilight.

                <p>
                    For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations 
                    about its axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of 
                    Mercury constantly faced the Sun. Thirteen times a century Mercury can 
                    be observed from the Earth passing across the face of the Sun in an event 
                    called a transit.
