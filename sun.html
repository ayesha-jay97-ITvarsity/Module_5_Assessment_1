                    The Sun or Sol, is the star at the centre of our solar system and is 
                    responsible for the Earth's climate and weather. 
                </p>             

                <p>
                    The Sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just 10km in 
                    diameter between the poles and the equator. The average radius of the Sun 
                    is 695,508 km (109.2 x that of the Earth) of which 20-25% is the core.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If a hollow Sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 
                    would fit inside. On the other hand if these Earths were squished inside 
                    with no wasted space then around 1,300,000 would fit inside. The Sun's 
                    surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earth's.
