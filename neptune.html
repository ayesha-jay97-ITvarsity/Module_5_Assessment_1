                    Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun making it the most distant in 
                    the solar system.

                <p>
                    This gas giant planet may have formed much closer to the Sun in early 
                    solar system history before migrating to its present position.

                <p> Despite being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. Below 
                    its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is made of layers of hydrogen, helium, and 
                    methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, ammonia and methane ice. 
                    The inner core of the planet is made of rock.
